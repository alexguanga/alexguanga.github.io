# Bro, do you even read?
I’m not going to lie that reading was my passion since I was a child. There were books that I liked here and there, but it was never a daily habit. As a freshman in college, I learned that a lot of successful people read: Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett, Mark Cuban, and the list continues. Thus, I made it a goal to make reading a daily habit. I think reading has helped me articulate my thoughts better and has taught me ideas I wouldn’t have learned if I only relied on a formal education.
