# Hi, I'm Alex.


### Core
I am big data junkie. I am majoring (hopefully in December 2017) in Economics with minors in Computer Science and Mathematics. I have been finding the journey of data science, machine learning, and analytics fun and informative. I have completed a few projects and will continue to do so. Some of the models I have worked with

- **KNN, K-Means, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regressions, and Linear Regression.**

I have completed side projects. I like to align my side projects with concepts and topics that I am most passionate about. This tends to finance, customer behavior, baseball, and socioeconomics.


### Past-Times
Baseball, hip-hop, reading, and fitness have always been a part of my life. I have enjoyed baseball ever since I was five. I have no concrete remembrance of this passion but who the hell cares. Given that I am a New Yorker, I am a Mets fan, which shows a lot about my patience. Other things that I like doing is working out and reading books. You can check out the books I read on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/booktheories).

Top 5 Rappers of all-time? Kendrick, Nas, Eminem, Big L, and J. Cole.
