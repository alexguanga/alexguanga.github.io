# Confidence Interval
If we are using linear regression, one of the important to realize is that the line of best fit cannot be perfect. Errors are unavoidable or else you might be Nate Silver. We will never have a perfect predictive model. We tend to the confidence interval to comfort us that the result will fall within a certain range. This sometimes is a 95% confidence interval where we have 2.5% percents at tails. If we have any information on the parameter, we will question that because that does not seem plausible.

# Prediction Interval
The data we are collecting will never be accurate. The questionnaire might not be answered accurately. The Data Analyst has queried incorrect data.  There's nothing that prevent these mistakes. Thus, generally, the distance in the prediction interval is larger than the confidence interval.
