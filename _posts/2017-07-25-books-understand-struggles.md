# 5 Books That Helped Me Understand YOUR Struggles

## Using books to break misconceptions and create healthier perspectives.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*LoCWX8YVUcl_QEyKaDyJIA.png)

I am fortunate to born and raised in Queens, New York. I lived here my whole
life. I have friends from all different backgrounds. I have friendships that
range from young children down the block to old senior citizens at the library.
But some people are not as fortunate as me. They are secluded from the rest of
the world. Their friends, relatives, and acquaintances tend to look like them.

During my last semester in college, I met a girl who’s from Idaho. She said that
her inner circle back home are all Caucasian. I can’t even fathom that idea.
After 18 years, she never had any friendship with people that did not look like
her. It’s not her fault. And she isn’t a racist. But she’ll never truly
understand the struggles of a minority.

And this got me thinking. I was reading, “The Souls of Black Folk” by W. E. B.
Du Bois, when it struck me. I don’t KNOW the struggle of being an
African-American. I have an idea. But I don’t know it. Though I’m aware of
explicit and implicit racism, I don’t know the residue that the Jim Crows and
slavery still has on African-American. The book helped me rethink my ideas and
beliefs. Hence, my optimism within the power of books.

Now to the fun part. As an avid book reader, I have come across some real good
books. Some of the good books helped me break biases and gain fresh
perspectives. Hence, I created a list of 5 books that I think will greatly help
widen YOUR experience.

> **The Diary of a Young Girl by Anne Frank**

I’m sure you’ve heard of this book. If not, shame on you. Just playing, but you
should seriously read this book. You probably learned about Hitler and the
Holocaust. And if you haven’t read this book, you probably never lived this era
through the eyes of a young teenage girl. This book deals with Anne’s coming of
age during Hitler’s reign. And I will never personally experience this which is
why I believe this book is so important.

Even now, we see differences between young girls and boys. Being raised in a
Hispanic household, I learned that there is some implicit favoritism towards
males. And a lot of the times, these young girls aren’t heard. Hence, I enjoyed
learning about the frustrations and emotions that Anne Frank had during Hitler’s
reign.

> **Monster: The Autobiography of an L.A. Gang Member by Sanyika Shakur and
> Monster Kody Scott**

This book is fucking vivid. Monster Kody, a hardcore gang member, explains his
journey within this book. This topic this book covers range from joining the
gang to going to jail and starting a family.

This book helped me rethink my journey. Most of my peers didn’t go to college.
In fact, some went to prison. But in my opinion, they are genuine people. We did
well academically in elementary and middle school. But some of them had
struggles that I didn’t struggle with, like the absences of a father figure.
This book helped me appreciate the small pieces that went right for me.

If for some reason you believe you’re better than the friends who didn’t pan out
as good as you, read this book.

> **Angela’s Ashes by Frank McCourt**

If you’re like me, you probably never heard of Frank McCourt. And if you’re like
me, you probably don’t know why he deserves an autobiography.

The main lesson that I toke from this book is the fight we have with ourselves.
Frank’s father is the centerpiece to this autobiography. His dad struggled with
alcoholism. Whenever he saved some money, he would intend to use it for his
children but would end up splurging it on drinks. I gained the trouble people
face with addiction. A lot of times, I judge these people.

This book taught me not to judge people. While some are ok with their
addictions, I do think that there are others who do want to change their habits.
But they are so entrenched with their vices, that their vices get the best of
them. They might be doing the best they can but can’t seem to be making
progress. This book will help you feel more empathy for those who struggle with
addiction.

> **Born a Crime by Trevor Noah**

This book is newer than the previous books. Trevor Noah is the host of the Daily
Show. Can his book bring value? I think so.

His background is diverse. His mom is black while his dad is white. Hence, the
title of his book. Deeper than that, he offers the perspective of being mixed in
South Africa. You learn that being black in America and being black in South
Africa might have some similarities, but there are large differences.

The main takeaway from this book is learning the same social-economic issue we
face but in another country. It’s important to know that despite the adversity
minorities face, it’s nothing compared to others is developing countries

> **The Other Wes Moore by Wes Moore**

This lesson from this book is very similar to Monster Kody’s book. However,
there’s one huge difference. We get to the result of small changes in two
similar background.

The author details his personal life and the life of another man, who happens to
be Wes Moore as well. One of them ends up in jail while the other is an author.
Other than being interesting, I helped me look in the mirror and say that I’m
not better than those young adults in prison. Yes, to society I might be. I know
I could have had their lifestyle if it wasn’t for small adjustments from my
parents.
