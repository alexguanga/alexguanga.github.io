 I do have a life. I do not only prioritize work and improving in the data science field. Most people would not agree with that statement. They just hatin'. Anyways, the following are some of my favorite past times.




****
<h2 style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">Baseball</h2>

<br>
<p>I have been a fan since 5.
<br>
I do not know where the passion stems from since I have a Latino background.
<br>
Wherever this passion emerged from, I am fortunate I found "baseball."
<br>
I am a New Yorker and from Queens, so by proximity, I am a huge Mets fans.
<br>
I cried in 2007, 2008, and 2015 (I am only 22, so I do not recall 2000). </p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">Hip Hop</h2>
<div align="center">

<br>
<p>Again, I was not raised with hip-hop in my household.
<br>
But at 13, I discovered Eminem and was hooked ever since.
<br>
Even though I am fairly young, I do not enjoy much of the trap music.
<br>
Some of my favorite current rappers are Cole, Kendrick, Joey Bada$$,
<br>
Mac Miller, Ab-Soul, J.I.D, and CyHi the Prynce.
<br>
Top 5 Rappers of all-time? (In order) Kendrick, Nas, Eminem, Big L, and J. Cole.  </p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">Reading</h2>
<div align="center">

<br>
I enjoyed reading but hated that it felt like an obligation because the
<br>
books were hand-picked by teachers. But I must say,
<br>
I had to mature before fully understanding some of these books.
<br>
Ever since college, I read every day for at least 35 minutes.
<br>
It has helped me grow and dissect information from professionals.
