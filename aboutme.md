# Hi, I'm Alex.

## _"Youth is wasted on the young."_ - George Bernard Shaw
- My journey begins New York. Born and raised in Queens, I have encompassed the New York City vibe: work hard and get yours. Or like one of my favorite rappers writes, _Nothing's equivalent to the New York state of mind_.
- I am recent graduate of the City University of New York, Hunter College. I majored in Economics and minors in Computer Science and Mathematics. During my academic career, I have interned at an NGO, a start-up, and a library. 
- I was fortunate I found Data Science/Machine Learning. I was also fortunate I crafted an interdisciplinary that prepared with the technical and theoretical frameworks in data science. Using these skills, I have built my skill set by taking Coursera and Udemy courses in data science. I will be creating a review on these courses so stay tuned! Moreover, these courses have helped me tackle side projects on finance, socioeconomic, human behavior, and really anything that captures my attention.

## Anything else?
- Of course. These are some of my favorite past-times. 
## Baseball
- I have been a fan since 5. I do not know where the passion stems from since I have a Latino background. Wherever this passion emerged from, I am fortunate I found "baseball." I am a New Yorker and from Queens, so by proximity, I am a huge Mets fans. I cried in 2007, 2008, and 2015 (I am only 22, so I do not recall 2000). 
## Hip-Hop
- Again, I was not raised with hip-hop in my household. But at 13, I discovered Eminem and was hooked ever since. Even though I am fairly young, I do not enjoy much of the trap music. Some of my favorite current rappers are Cole, Kendrick, Joey Bada$$, Mac Miller, Ab-Soul, J.I.D, and CyHi the Prynce. 
- Top 5 Rappers of all-time? (In order) Kendrick, Nas, Eminem, Big L, and J. Cole.  
## Reading
- I enjoyed reading but hated that it felt like an obligation because the books were hand-picked by teachers. But I must say, I had to mature before fully understanding some of these books. Ever since college, I read every day for at least 35 minutes. It has helped me grow and dissect information from professionals. Here's a link to my [Instagram on books I read](https://www.instagram.com/booktheories/).
